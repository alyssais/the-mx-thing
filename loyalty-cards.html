PLACEHOLDER FILE - notes only atm

Bite Card - https://www.bitecard.co.uk/activate - title used to be mandatory, but isn't any more. When I signed up, I used the DOM inspector method to add Mx to the dropdown and it got printed on the card I got in the post :D
Nectar Card - https://www.nectar.com/new-card - title is mandatory, "Other" is an option, but selecting "Other" (or "Dr") reveals required binary gender buttons (which automatically tick themselves and hide when selecting any traditional gendered title)
