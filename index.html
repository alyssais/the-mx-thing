<h1>The Mx Thing</h1>
<h2>The very basic initial thing (yes it looks like trash)</h2>
<p>Here's the website where I write down my experiences trying to maintain a non-binary identity as a <strong>UK resident</strong> (so I'm sorry if this is not super useful for you, but these are my genuine experiences).</p>
<p><strong>A caveat:</strong>I am interpreting "prefer not to say" as a non-binary option in gender fields. This might not make you happy, but it's enough for me; ditto fields being optional.</p>
  <p>Feel free to contribute via the <a href="https://github.com/theshillito/the-mx-thing/">GitHub</a> (either as issues or pull requests).</p>
