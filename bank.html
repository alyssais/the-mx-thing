  </ul>
<h3>Natwest</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Current account with debit card</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> Existing customer</li>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Face-to-face (Knutsford branch) </li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Mx title applied to account and debit card. </li>
    <li><strong>Note from Peter:</strong> When this was done, their main system for doing changes would not let the staff member change the title to Mx. However, the staff member went into some console/DOS looking screens and manually typed in Mx in numerous screens (it took a while, but they were very keen to do it everywhere). Unfortunately, there was one place they missed (paper statements) but I told the Crewe branch and they fixed this</li>
  </ul>
