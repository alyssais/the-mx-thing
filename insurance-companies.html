<h2>Cover yourself up</h2>
<p>These are the actual insurers (<a href="insurance-comparisons.html">not comparison sites, see here</a>)</p>

<h3>A Choice</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product:</strong> Car insurance</li>
    <li><strong>Status:</strong> New customer (via Compare the Market)</li>
    <li><strong>Method:</strong> Email</li>
    <li><strong>Process:</strong> So, through Compare the Market, I applied to A Choice with an "Ms" title. I then contacted A Choice to get my titled changed to Mx. The response I got confirmed that Mx was applied to the insurance (complete with new insurance certificate with the new title). However, they requested that I choose which binary "sex" I wished to have on my account, as they can't leave it blank. Out of fear of being accused of fraud were I ever to have an accident on this policy, I chose the one I am legally, but I appreciate that they asked me to choose. Fast forward a few weeks, and I am told that their internal system (as in, the "A Choice" system) would currently not accept Mx as a title and their IT department is going to make alterations to allow for it as I'm not the only one who's requested it from them. However, the main insurance system does accept Mx as a title, which is how I got the insurance certificate with the correct title on. As the internal system is the one that issues automatic emails and letters, they will still say Mr for the time being.</li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> Mx on insurance certificate, Mr on correspondence until their systems have been changed.</li> 
  </ul>
